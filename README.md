# Coin Toss Game

## About This Project

I built this **Coin Toss Game** using React, where users can toss a virtual coin and track the number of heads and tails. The game randomly generates the toss result and updates the count accordingly.

### Features

- Displays an initial screen with a heads image and count values set to **0**.
- Clicking the **Toss Coin** button generates a random toss result.
- The result updates the displayed image and increments the respective counters.
- Tracks the total number of tosses along with separate counts for heads and tails.

## How I Built It

This project was built using **React.js** with component-based development. The key implementation details include:

- Used **React State** to manage the count of heads, tails, and total tosses.
- Generated toss results using:
  ```js
  const tossResult = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
  ```
- Updated the UI dynamically based on state changes.
- Styled the components using **CSS**.
